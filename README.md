### 👷‍♂️ About Me

I'm a **Civil Engineering student at NIT Trichy** who somehow fell in love with software development more than structures.

- 💻 I write code, break things, fix them, and pretend it was all part of the plan.  
- 🧠 I enjoy building stuff that solves real (or imaginary) problems.  
- 💡 Got a weird project idea? Ping me. I love working on anything that makes me go:  
  **“Wait… that might actually work!”**

### 🧪 What I'm Exploring

- 🔍 development
- ⚙️ C++ (and its bad habits)  
- 📜 Reading docs I’ll ignore anyway  
- 🧠 Problem-solving on LeetCode (and occasionally surviving it)

---

### 😅 Fun Facts

- ☕ Why code? Because it’s the only place I can CTRL+Z my mistakes  
- 🔧 Debugging is like being a detective… in a crime I committed  
- 🧩 Solving problems I don’t fully understand using tools I just learned 5 minutes ago  
- 📞 Open to collabs, ideas, or just rants over tea (or coffee, no bias here)
